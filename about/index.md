## In A Nutshell...
Junior Developer, with more than three years of mobile development experience. Broadening experience to web development for a widespread application base.  My strengths lie in BackEnd Development, particulary in heavy logic and databases. Able to incorporate web frameworks with the use of APIs, such as the Google Maps API. I thrive on creating applications that are accessible to all users.
