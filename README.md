# My Portfolio

This site was created using the Jekyll generator and hosted with GitHub Pages. It is in place to showcase what I have learned in my time at Lighthouse Labs, a programming school teaching code in a bootcamp-style. This immersive course has taught me a brief introduction into the world of Web Development and because if this teaching I ma now a full-fledged Backend Developer working as a Rails Developer at a Startup Company located in Toronto, Canada. 

If you would like to view the finished product and see how Jekyll is able to take ordinary Markdown and generate the HTML associated with it, please visit [Here](https://rh0delta.github.io).
